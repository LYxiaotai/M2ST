## What is SpaMask?

![Figure1_overview.png](https://github.com/LYxiaotai/SpaMask/blob/main/Figure1_overview.png)

SpaMask, a Graph ATtention auto-Encoder framework featuring two Masking strategies: masked feature reconstruction and re-mask decoding. 

* The graph attention module in SpaMask enables adaptive learning of local spatial neighbors, while the masking strategies enhance model robustness, resulting in stable latent representations with more core biological information. 

* SpaMask adopts an edge removal strategy to construct an enhanced spatial graph, which is more specific for the domain identification task, facilitating clearer delineation of domain boundaries. 

* By employing mask strategies and integrating gene expression data with the enhanced spatial graph, M2GATE learns stable latent representations that improve spatial domain identification and downstream analyses, such as tissue structure visualization, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization, spatial trajectory inference, pseudo-spatiotemporal map (pSM) analysis and discovery of domain-specific marker genes.


## How to use SpaMask?
